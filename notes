<!-- <Route path={'/login'} element={<Login/>} -->

<!-- <link to ="'/login">login</link>  -->
to yaha pr humne url de diya ki agr login pr click ho to is link pr jao or us link pr jo page dalna h wo humne route ki help se daal diya 

after that we made login and register page 
in register page we add method post to send data to server

in api we created index.js 
in which express and other libraries installed 
BZWPfKUFwD6gxZwr password for mongodb

mongodb+srv://ash242242:<BZWPfKUFwD6gxZwr>@cluster0.5v4v8rn.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
connectionstring



CONNECT WITH BACKEND  {
    
so basically first we made a new project on mongo db after then we choose free stroage sectin fro our project
after that we click on connect and then we choose OPEN WITH APPLICATIONf feature and copy the connectin string 
after that we need to have model to know in which form our data should be present 
after that we create a user.js file in which we created a userschema which ell in which form our data will remains 
after that we make a usermodel and connect it with the usermodel
}


Register{

    we have created a user in post method of index.js at /register  and passed username and password 
    so through it when a person click on register 
    then data will go to method post and passed into the usermodel and a usermodel data has been created in the database



    in the register page if somehow data is wrong present in emal and password then response will  not give status code of 400 so we imlement a alert request that registration is successful or not
}



Login{
    same fetch request as register 
    and in index.js first i find the user from User.findOne and then compare the password usign bcrypt.comparesync if 
    the password is correct then we gernrate a jwt token for our cookie in which we pass username,secretkey, and  a callback function 
    then we create acookei by res.cookie('token',token) and name he cookie token 
    after then in login.jsx we take the response and check that the response.ok it rue or not 
    if it is true then we say that login successful and then we navigate the page to our main page by using navigator
    and by the use of usestate redirect 
}

{
    after login login and register should disappear but how?
}
